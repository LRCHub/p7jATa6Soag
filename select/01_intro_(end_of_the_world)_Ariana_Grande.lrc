[00:19.95] Uh
[00:20.93] How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship
[00:24.65] Aren't you really supposed to know that ****
[00:27.34] Feel it in your bones and own that ****
[00:29.68] I don't know
[00:30.69] Then I had this interaction I've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks
[00:34.77] Wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling
[00:37.54] Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspiring me
[00:40.77] Wonder if he's judging me like I am right now
[00:44.65] I don't care
[00:46.90] I'd rather tell the truth
[00:48.97] Truth
[00:49.82] Than make it worse for you
[00:51.77] You
[00:52.40] Mmm
[00:53.43] If the sun refused to shine
[00:58.22] Baby would I still be your lover
[01:02.26] Would you want me there
[01:04.60] If the moon went dark tonight
[01:09.67] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:13.61] Would I be the one on your mind your mind your mind
[01:20.93] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:24.84] Would you be the one on mine
