[00:19.52] Uh
[00:20.55] How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
[00:24.42] Aren't you really supposed to know that shit?
[00:26.92] Feel it in your bones and own that shit
[00:29.41] I don't know
[00:30.48] Then I had this interaction I've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks
[00:34.44] Wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling
[00:37.20] Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspiring me
[00:40.35] Wonder if he's judging me like I am right now
[00:44.34] I don't care
[00:50.34] 
[00:46.52] I'd rather tell the truth (truth)
[00:49.51] Than make it worse for you, mmm (you)
[00:53.09] If the sun refused to shine
[00:58.00] Baby, would I still be your lover?
[01:01.91] Would you want me there?
[01:04.13] If the moon went dark tonight
[01:09.33] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:13.24] Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
[01:40.24] 
[01:20.61] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:24.56] Would you be the one on mine?
[01:27.31] Please, pay me no mind
[01:31.95] While I jump into your skin and change your eyes
[01:38.53] So you see things through mine (through mine, through mine, through mine)
[01:43.21] Can't you sense me? I've been right here all this time (all this time)
[01:51.00] Would you still be here, pretending you still like me? (would you still be?)
[01:55.15] Pretending you don't regret, not thinking before asking
[02:00.86] Now, you're long gone in cali (now, you're long gone)
[02:03.80] And me, I'm still unpacking (i'm still unpacking)
[02:06.61] Why I even allowed you on the flight
[02:24.61] 
[02:11.33] I broke your heart because you broke mine (i broke your heart)
[02:14.98] So me, I am the bad guy (me, I am the bad guy)
[02:17.75] 'Cause I'd already grieved you
[02:20.74] And you started to realize
[02:23.75] I do need ya
[02:26.21] I did
[02:28.85] I wish I could un-need ya
[02:31.40] So I did
