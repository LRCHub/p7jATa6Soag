[00:19.00] Uh
[00:20.84] How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
[00:24.67] Aren't you really supposed to know that shit?
[00:27.12] Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know
[00:30.55] Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks
[00:34.38] Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling
[00:37.43] Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me
[00:40.60] Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now
[00:44.43] I don't care
[00:46.71] I'd rather tell the truth (truth)
[00:49.39] Than make it worse for you (you), mm
[00:53.11] If the sun refused to shine
[00:58.11] Baby, would I still be your lover?
[01:02.18] Would you want me there?
[01:04.35] If the moon went dark tonight
[01:09.55] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:13.43] Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?
[01:20.87] And if it all ended tomorrow
[01:24.71] Would you be the one on mine?
