Uh
How can I tell if I'm
in the right relationship?
Aren't you really supposed
to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones
and own that shit
I don't know
Then I had this interaction
I've been thinking 'bout
for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinking 'bout
it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that
that's been what's inspiring me
Wonder if he's judging me
like I am right now
I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth
(truth)
Than make it worse for you, mmm
(you)
If the sun refused to shine
Baby,
would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind,
your mind, your mind?
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?
